.. py:function:: analyze_structure(atoms: ase.Atoms, covalent_scale: float = 1.2) -> tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray, list[list[int]]]

   Analyzes an ASE Atoms object to calculate the distance matrix, bond matrix,
   and identify molecular fragments.

   Args:
       atoms: The ASE Atoms object to analyze.
       covalent_scale:  A scaling factor applied to the covalent radii to
           determine the bonding threshold.  A bond is formed if the distance
           between two atoms is less than or equal to the sum of their
           covalent radii, multiplied by this factor.

   Returns:
       A tuple containing:
       - distance_matrix: A NumPy array representing the pairwise distances
         between all atoms in the system.
       - bond_matrix: A NumPy array representing the adjacency matrix of the
         molecular graph.  bond_matrix[i, j] = 1 if atoms i and j are
         bonded, and 0 otherwise.
       - fragments: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices
         of the atoms belonging to a connected fragment.
