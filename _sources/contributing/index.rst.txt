Contributing to ``rgpycrumbs``
==============================


We welcome all contributions and contributors to ``rgpycrumbs``. Whether you
report bugs, improve documentation, or submit code, your help makes the tools
better for everyone.

Communication and Conduct
-------------------------

We value a respectful and inclusive community. All contributors must follow our
`Code of Conduct <https://rgpycrumbs.rgoswami.me/code_of_conduct.html>`_. 

Getting Started
---------------

Please review the technical requirements before submitting a Pull Request:

Development Environment
    We use ``pixi`` for environment management. 
    Read the `Testing & Environment Requirements <test_requirements.rst>`_ to understand how to handle 
    conflicting dependencies.

Code Style
    We follow a "Dispatcher" pattern detailed in the `design and architecture notes <~/Git/Github/Python/rgpycrumbs/docs/orgmode/devnotes.rst>`_. Keep core logic in 
    independent scripts using PEP 723 metadata as per these `real python best practices <https://realpython.com/python-script-structure/>`_.

Documentation
    We author all documentation in ``orgmode`` converted to ``rst``,
    with the workflow and standards in the `Documentation Standards & Authoring <doc_builds.rst>`_ section.

Reporting Issues
----------------

Use the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/HaoZeke/rgpycrumbs/issues>`_ to report bugs or suggest enhancements. Please
provide a minimal reproducible example for all bug reports. User facing comments
may be directed also to the `EON materials science section <https://matsci.org/c/eon/72>`_.
