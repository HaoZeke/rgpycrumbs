The following projects use ``rgpycrumbs`` as a dependency or tool.

Libraries
---------

`chemparseplot <https://github.com/HaoZeke/chemparseplot>`_
    Parsers and plotting tools for computational chemistry. Uses
    ``rgpycrumbs.basetypes``, ``rgpycrumbs.interpolation``, ``rgpycrumbs.surfaces``,
    and ``rgpycrumbs.parsers`` as core dependencies.

Research Software
-----------------

`eOn <https://github.com/TheochemUI/eOn>`_
    Long-timescale molecular dynamics code. Documentation references
    ``rgpycrumbs`` as the companion diagnostic and visualization suite
    (`docs <https://eon.theochemui.org/>`_).

Reproducibility Packages
------------------------

`nebmmf\ :sub:`repro`\ <https://github.com/HaoZeke/nebmmf_repro>`_
    Reproduction package for NEB machine-learned force field
    work. Uses ``rgpycrumbs`` CLI for NEB plotting and the alignment API.

`nebviz\ :sub:`repro`\ <https://github.com/HaoZeke/nebviz_repro>`_
    Reproduction package for 2D NEB visualization methods. Imports
    ``rgpycrumbs.eon.helpers`` and runs the CLI for 2D landscape plots.

`otgpd\ :sub:`repro`\ <https://github.com/TheochemUI/otgpd_repro>`_
    Reproduction package for on-the-fly GP dimer searches. Imports
    ``rgpycrumbs._aux``, runs CLI for GP trajectory analysis and fragment detection.

`gpr\ :sub:`sella`\ \ :sub:`repro`\ <https://github.com/TheochemUI/gpr_sella_repro>`_
    Reproduction package for GP-accelerated Sella saddle point
    searches (ChemPhysChem, doi: `10.1002/cphc.202500730 <https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202500730>`_). Uses ``rgpycrumbs`` for
    auxiliary helpers, parsers, and structure analysis.

`brms\ :sub:`idrot`\ \ :sub:`repro`\ <https://github.com/HaoZeke/brms_idrot_repro>`_
    Bayesian reaction mechanism studies reproduction package.
    Uses both ``rgpycrumbs`` and ``chemparseplot`` for parsing and analysis.

External Projects
-----------------

`atomistic-cookbook <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/atomistic-cookbook>`_ (lab-cosmo)
    Community cookbook for atomistic simulations.
    The `eOn PET-NEB example <https://atomistic-cookbook.org/examples/eon-pet-neb/eon-pet-neb.html>`_ imports ``rgpycrumbs.eon.helpers`` and
    ``rgpycrumbs.run.jupyter``.

`metatensor ecosystem-article <https://github.com/metatensor/ecosystem-article>`_ (metatensor)
    Metatensor ecosystem paper. Uses
    ``rgpycrumbs`` for eOn NEB plotting and PLUMED FES reconstruction workflows.
