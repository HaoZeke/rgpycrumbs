Notebook Execution Helpers
--------------------------

Running shell commands and complex scientific workflows inside Jupyter
notebooks can often lead to verbose and "scary" boilerplate code.

  .. versionadded:: 0.1.0

The \`rgpycrumbs.run.jupyter\` module provides clean abstractions for subprocess
management and configuration generation, designed specifically for tutorial
notebooks (like those in the Atomistic Cookbook).

Subprocess Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``run_command_or_exit`` function streams \`stdout\` and \`stderr\` in real-time
to the notebook cell output, ensuring long-running simulation jobs (like
\`eonclient\`) don't appear to hang.

.. code:: python

    from rgpycrumbs.run.jupyter import run_command_or_exit

    # Runs 'eonclient', streams output, and raises SystemExit on failure
    # This prevents the notebook from continuing if the simulation crashes.
    run_command_or_exit(["eonclient"], timeout=300)

Configuration Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of writing \`config.ini\` files using fragile f-strings, use
``write_eon_config`` to generate them from Python dictionaries.

.. code:: python

    from rgpycrumbs.run.jupyter import write_eon_config

    settings = {
        "Main": {"job": "nudged_elastic_band"},
        "Potential": {"potential": "Metatomic"},
    }

    # Writes to ./config.ini safely
    write_eon_config(".", settings)
