Library Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rgpycrumbs.geom`` package also includes importable library modules:

``rgpycrumbs.geom.analysis``
    Structure analysis: distance matrices, bond
    matrices, fragment detection, centroid distances, and RMSD-corrected
    distances. Uses ASE's ``NeighborList`` and depth-first search for fragment
    identification.

``rgpycrumbs.geom.ira``
    IRA (Iterative Rotations and Assignments) matching
    for RMSD-based structure comparison. Provides ``do_ira()``, ``calculate_rmsd()``,
    and ``is_ira_pair()`` functions along with the ``IRAComp`` dataclass.
