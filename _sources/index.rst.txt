Overview
--------

``rgpycrumbs`` functions as a unified dispatcher for research scripts and
computational utilities, tailored for computational chemistry.

``rgpycrumbs`` employs `PEP 723 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/>`_ metadata to isolate dependencies for each tool
individually. This architecture ensures:

Conflict-Free Execution
    Scripts with incompatible requirements like 
    different ``numpy`` versions run side-by-side without issue.

On-Demand Retrieval
    The core package remains lightweight. The system
    fetches heavy libraries (like ``ase`` or ``matplotlib``) via ``uv`` only when
    executing a script that requires them.

Strict Reproducibility
    Every script explicitly declares its necessary
    environment, preventing "works on my machine" errors.

Broadly speaking, the tooling here assists with computational methods to find
reaction pathways, along with packaging helpers.

Advanced NEB Visualization
--------------------------

The :doc:`plt-neb tool <tools/eon/plt_neb>` offers novel visualization
capabilities for Nudged Elastic Band calculations:

Force-Corrected Interpolation
    Uses Hermite splines incorporating force
    projections to produce physically consistent energy profiles.

2D Energy Landscapes
    Projects reaction paths onto Reactant/Product RMSD
    coordinates to reveal path complexity often hidden in 1D profiles.

Structural Context
    Automatically renders and embeds atomic structure insets
    for critical points or all images directly onto the plots.

Simulation Setup & Analysis
---------------------------

EON
~~~

NEB initial path generation
    :doc:`con-splitter <tools/eon/con_splitter>`
    simplifies the generation of initial paths enabling for instance ``IDPP``
    initialization through ``ase`` by processing multi-image trajectories into
    EON-compatible input lists.

Defect Identification
    :doc:`ptmdisp <tools/eon/ptmdisp>`
    employs Polyhedral Template Matching via ``OVITO`` to algorithmically identify
    and index interstitial defects in crystalline systems.

``NWChem`` Input Generation
    :doc:`generate-nwchem-input <tools/eon/generate_nwchem_input>`
    generates complete input files compatible with EON's ``SocketNWChemPot``,
    merging geometry data with calculation settings.

PLUMED
~~~~~~

Free Energy Reconstruction
    Pure-python implementations for reconstructing
    bias potentials from PLUMED hills files.

Infrastructure & Maintenance
----------------------------

Prefix.dev Management
    ``delete_packages`` helps maintain  custom Conda/Pixi
    channels by automating the cleanup of old or specific package versions on
    `prefix.dev <https://prefix.dev>`_.

Utility Functions
-----------------

Beyond the command line tools, the package includes **pure-python** helpers for
parsing logs like those from `bless <https://crates.io/crates/bless>`_ and managing data structures in Jupyter
notebooks.
