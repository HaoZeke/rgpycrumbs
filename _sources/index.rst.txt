Ecosystem Overview
------------------

The ``rgpycrumbs`` suite consists of several interlinked projects designed to
streamline computational chemistry workflows.

Overview
--------

``rgpycrumbs`` is a computational library and CLI toolkit for chemical physics
research. It provides both **importable library modules** for computational
tasks and a **dispatcher-based CLI** for running self-contained research scripts.

Library Modules
    Importable Python modules for surface fitting (JAX-based
    kernel methods), structure analysis (distance matrices, fragment detection),
    IRA matching (RMSD-based structure comparison), spline interpolation, and
    shared data types for NEB paths and saddle searches.

CLI Dispatcher
    A unified command-line interface that employs `PEP 723 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/>`_
    metadata to isolate dependencies per script via ``uv``, ensuring conflict-free
    and reproducible execution.

Broadly speaking, the tooling here assists with computational methods to find
reaction pathways, along with packaging helpers.

Advanced NEB Visualization
--------------------------

The :doc:`plt-neb tool <tools/eon/plt_neb>` offers novel visualization
capabilities for Nudged Elastic Band calculations:

Force-Corrected Interpolation
    Uses Hermite splines incorporating force
    projections to produce physically consistent energy profiles.

2D Energy Landscapes
    Projects reaction paths onto Reactant/Product RMSD
    coordinates to reveal path complexity often hidden in 1D profiles.

Structural Context
    Automatically renders and embeds atomic structure insets
    for critical points or all images directly onto the plots.

Simulation Setup & Analysis
---------------------------

eOn
~~~

NEB initial path generation
    :doc:`con-splitter <tools/eon/con_splitter>`
    simplifies the generation of initial paths enabling for instance ``IDPP``
    initialization through ``ase`` by processing multi-image trajectories into
    eOn-compatible input lists.

Defect Identification
    :doc:`ptmdisp <tools/eon/ptmdisp>`
    employs Polyhedral Template Matching via ``OVITO`` to algorithmically identify
    and index interstitial defects in crystalline systems.

``NWChem`` Input Generation
    :doc:`generate-nwchem-input <tools/eon/generate_nwchem_input>`
    generates complete input files compatible with eOn's ``SocketNWChemPot``,
    merging geometry data with calculation settings.

ORCA
~~~~

Input Generation
    :doc:`generate-orca-input <tools/orca/generate_orca_input>`
    generates ORCA input files from TOML configurations, supporting NEB and single-point runs.

PLUMED
~~~~~~

Free Energy Reconstruction
    Pure-python implementations for reconstructing
    bias potentials from PLUMED hills files.

Infrastructure & Maintenance
----------------------------

Prefix.dev Management
    ``delete_packages`` helps maintain  custom Conda/Pixi
    channels by automating the cleanup of old or specific package versions on
    `prefix.dev <https://prefix.dev>`_.

Library API
-----------

Beyond the CLI tools, ``rgpycrumbs`` provides importable library modules:

``rgpycrumbs.surfaces``
    JAX-based surface fitting with TPS, RBF, Matern 5/2,
    SE, and IMQ kernels. Includes gradient-enhanced variants for energy landscape
    interpolation. Install with ``pip install rgpycrumbs[surfaces]``.

``rgpycrumbs.geom.analysis``
    Structure analysis: distance matrices, bond
    matrices, and fragment detection via ASE's ``NeighborList``. Install with ``pip install rgpycrumbs[analysis]``.

``rgpycrumbs.geom.ira``
    Iterative Rotations and Assignments (IRA) for
    RMSD-based structure comparison. Install with ``pip install rgpycrumbs[ira]``.

``rgpycrumbs.interpolation``
    Spline interpolation utilities built on SciPy.
    Install with ``pip install rgpycrumbs[interpolation]``.

``rgpycrumbs.basetypes``
    Shared data structures (``nebiter``, ``nebpath``,
    ``SaddleMeasure``, ``DimerOpt``, ``MolGeom``, ``SpinID``) used across ``rgpycrumbs``
    and ``chemparseplot``. No extra dependencies required.

Utility Functions
-----------------

The package also includes **pure-python** helpers for parsing logs like those from
`bless <https://crates.io/crates/bless>`_ and managing data structures in Jupyter notebooks.
