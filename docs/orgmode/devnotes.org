* Documentation Pipeline
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       docs-architecture
  :END:

We craft documents in ~orgmode~, though downstream processing uses ~sphinx~.
Partially because of this, since ~ox-rst~ needs ~emacs~, and because the
documentation rarely needs to be built outside of the development workflow,
instead of staying within the ~pyproject~ file as an optional dependency the
documentation forms a new environment in the ~pixi.toml~ file.
* Dependency management
- Library :: go in ~pyproject.toml~.
- Doc/Dev :: go in ~pixi.toml~.
- Script :: handled on-the-fly via the ~uv~ dispatching mechanism and [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/][PEP 723]] detailed in my [[https://realpython.com/python-script-structure/][RealPython best practices post]].
* Core Architecture: The Dispatcher
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       cli-dispatch
  :END:

** The Problem
Research pipelines require conflicting environments and a monolithic CLI
(e.g., standard ~Typer~ app) fails because importing the top-level module
crashes due to conflicting dependencies in sub-modules.

** The Solution: Dynamic Subprocess Dispatch
   Instead of directly importing modules, ~rgpycrumbs/cli.py~ controls execution flow:
   - It scans directory structure at runtime.
   - It invokes scripts via ~uv run~.
   - This leads to complete isolation for each script.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   # Logic captured in rgpycrumbs/cli.py
   subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_path] + args)
   #+END_SRC

** Philosophy

The library is designed with the following principles in mind:

- Dispatcher-Based Architecture :: The top-level ~rgpycrumbs.cli~ command acts as a
  lightweight dispatcher. It does not contain the core logic of the tools
  itself. Instead, it parses user commands to identify the target script and
  then invokes it in an isolated subprocess using the ~uv~ runner. This provides
  a unified command-line interface while keeping the tools decoupled.

- Isolated & Reproducible Execution :: Each script is a self-contained unit that
  declares its own dependencies via [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/][PEP 723]] metadata. The ~uv~ runner uses this
  information to resolve and install the exact required packages into a
  temporary, cached environment on-demand. This design guarantees
  reproducibility and completely eliminates the risk of dependency conflicts
  between different tools in the collection.

- Lightweight Core, On-Demand Dependencies :: The installable ~rgpycrumbs~
  package is minimal, with its only dependency being the ~click~ library for the
  CLI dispatcher. Heavy scientific libraries like ~matplotlib~  are not part of
  the base installation. They are fetched by ~uv~ only when a script that needs
  them is executed, ensuring the user's base Python environment remains clean
  and lightweight.

- Modular & Extensible Tooling :: Each utility is an independent script. This
  modularity simplifies development, testing, and maintenance, as changes to one
  tool cannot inadvertently affect another. New tools can be added to the
  collection without modifying the core dispatcher logic, making the system
  easily extensible.
