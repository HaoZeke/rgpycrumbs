* Overview
  ~rgpycrumbs~ is a computational library and CLI toolkit for chemical physics
  research. It provides both *importable library modules* for computational
  tasks and a *dispatcher-based CLI* for running self-contained research scripts.

- Library Modules :: Importable Python modules for surface fitting (JAX-based
  kernel methods), structure analysis (distance matrices, fragment detection),
  IRA matching (RMSD-based structure comparison), spline interpolation, and
  shared data types for NEB paths and saddle searches.
- CLI Dispatcher :: A unified command-line interface that employs [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/][PEP 723]]
  metadata to isolate dependencies per script via ~uv~, ensuring conflict-free
  and reproducible execution.

Broadly speaking, the tooling here assists with computational methods to find
reaction pathways, along with packaging helpers.
* Advanced NEB Visualization
The @@rst::doc:`plt-neb tool <tools/eon/plt_neb>`@@ offers novel visualization
capabilities for Nudged Elastic Band calculations:
- Force-Corrected Interpolation :: Uses Hermite splines incorporating force
  projections to produce physically consistent energy profiles.
- 2D Energy Landscapes :: Projects reaction paths onto Reactant/Product RMSD
  coordinates to reveal path complexity often hidden in 1D profiles.
- Structural Context :: Automatically renders and embeds atomic structure insets
  for critical points or all images directly onto the plots.
* Simulation Setup & Analysis
** eOn
- NEB initial path generation :: @@rst::doc:`con-splitter <tools/eon/con_splitter>`@@
  simplifies the generation of initial paths enabling for instance ~IDPP~
  initialization through ~ase~ by processing multi-image trajectories into
  eOn-compatible input lists.
- Defect Identification :: @@rst::doc:`ptmdisp <tools/eon/ptmdisp>`@@
  employs Polyhedral Template Matching via ~OVITO~ to algorithmically identify
  and index interstitial defects in crystalline systems.
- ~NWChem~ Input Generation :: @@rst::doc:`generate-nwchem-input <tools/eon/generate_nwchem_input>`@@
  generates complete input files compatible with eOn's ~SocketNWChemPot~,
  merging geometry data with calculation settings.
** PLUMED
- Free Energy Reconstruction :: Pure-python implementations for reconstructing
  bias potentials from PLUMED hills files.
* Infrastructure & Maintenance
- Prefix.dev Management :: ~delete_packages~ helps maintain  custom Conda/Pixi
  channels by automating the cleanup of old or specific package versions on
  [[https://prefix.dev][prefix.dev]].
* Library API
Beyond the CLI tools, ~rgpycrumbs~ provides importable library modules:

- ~rgpycrumbs.surfaces~ :: JAX-based surface fitting with TPS, RBF, Matern 5/2,
  SE, and IMQ kernels. Includes gradient-enhanced variants for energy landscape
  interpolation. Install with ~pip install rgpycrumbs[surfaces]~.
- ~rgpycrumbs.geom.analysis~ :: Structure analysis: distance matrices, bond
  matrices, and fragment detection via ASE's ~NeighborList~. Install with ~pip
  install rgpycrumbs[analysis]~.
- ~rgpycrumbs.geom.ira~ :: Iterative Rotations and Assignments (IRA) for
  RMSD-based structure comparison. Install with ~pip install rgpycrumbs[ira]~.
- ~rgpycrumbs.interpolation~ :: Spline interpolation utilities built on SciPy.
  Install with ~pip install rgpycrumbs[interpolation]~.
- ~rgpycrumbs.basetypes~ :: Shared data structures (~nebiter~, ~nebpath~,
  ~SaddleMeasure~, ~DimerOpt~, ~MolGeom~, ~SpinID~) used across ~rgpycrumbs~
  and ~chemparseplot~. No extra dependencies required.

* Utility Functions
The package also includes *pure-python* helpers for parsing logs like those from
[[https://crates.io/crates/bless][bless]] and managing data structures in Jupyter notebooks.
