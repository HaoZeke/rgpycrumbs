* Overview
  ~rgpycrumbs~ functions as a unified dispatcher for research scripts and
  computational utilities, tailored for computational chemistry.

~rgpycrumbs~ employs [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/][PEP 723]] metadata to isolate dependencies for each tool
individually. This architecture ensures:

- Conflict-Free Execution :: Scripts with incompatible requirements like 
  different ~numpy~ versions run side-by-side without issue.
- On-Demand Retrieval :: The core package remains lightweight. The system
  fetches heavy libraries (like ~ase~ or ~matplotlib~) via ~uv~ only when
  executing a script that requires them.
- Strict Reproducibility :: Every script explicitly declares its necessary
  environment, preventing "works on my machine" errors.

Broadly speaking, the tooling here assists with computational methods to find
reaction pathways, along with packaging helpers.
* Advanced NEB Visualization
The @@rst::doc:`plt-neb tool <tools/eon/plt_neb>`@@ offers novel visualization
capabilities for Nudged Elastic Band calculations:
- Force-Corrected Interpolation :: Uses Hermite splines incorporating force
  projections to produce physically consistent energy profiles.
- 2D Energy Landscapes :: Projects reaction paths onto Reactant/Product RMSD
  coordinates to reveal path complexity often hidden in 1D profiles.
- Structural Context :: Automatically renders and embeds atomic structure insets
  for critical points or all images directly onto the plots.
* Simulation Setup & Analysis
** EON
- NEB initial path generation :: @@rst::doc:`con-splitter <tools/eon/con_splitter>`@@
  simplifies the generation of initial paths enabling for instance ~IDPP~
  initialization through ~ase~ by processing multi-image trajectories into
  EON-compatible input lists.
- Defect Identification :: @@rst::doc:`ptmdisp <tools/eon/ptmdisp>`@@
  employs Polyhedral Template Matching via ~OVITO~ to algorithmically identify
  and index interstitial defects in crystalline systems.
- ~NWChem~ Input Generation :: @@rst::doc:`generate-nwchem-input <tools/eon/generate_nwchem_input>`@@
  generates complete input files compatible with EON's ~SocketNWChemPot~,
  merging geometry data with calculation settings.
** PLUMED
- Free Energy Reconstruction :: Pure-python implementations for reconstructing
  bias potentials from PLUMED hills files.
* Infrastructure & Maintenance
- Prefix.dev Management :: ~delete_packages~ helps maintain  custom Conda/Pixi
  channels by automating the cleanup of old or specific package versions on
  [[https://prefix.dev][prefix.dev]].
* Utility Functions
Beyond the command line tools, the package includes *pure-python* helpers for
parsing logs like those from [[https://crates.io/crates/bless][bless]] and managing data structures in Jupyter
notebooks.
