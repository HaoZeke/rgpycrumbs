#+TITLE: EON Tools

* Overview
  These tools handle [[https://eondocs.org][EON output files]].

* Plotting NEB Paths
  The ~plt_neb~ tool visualizes energy landscapes. It supports:
  - RMSD-RMSD 2D projections
  - Force-corrected Hermite splines

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT rst
  .. click:: rgpycrumbs.eon.plt_neb:main
     :prog: rgpycrumbs eon plt_neb
     :nested: full
  #+END_EXPORT

* Trajectory Splitting
This script takes a multi-image trajectory file (e.g., from a finished NEB
calculation) and splits it into individual frame files, creating an input file
for a new calculation.

To split a trajectory file:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
rgpycrumbs eon con-splitter neb_final_path.con -o initial_images
#+END_SRC

This will create a directory named ~initial_images~ containing ~ipath_000.con~,
~ipath_001.con~, etc., along with an ~ipath.dat~ file listing their paths.

** CLI options
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT rst
  .. click:: rgpycrumbs.eon.con_splitter:con_splitter
     :prog: rgpycrumbs eon con-splitter
     :nested: full
  #+END_EXPORT
